## How does it work

When a user comments on a blog post the Utterances bot searches for an issue in this repository with the issue name same as the URL and creates a new issue if it doesn't exist and the comment is appended on that issuse. The main requirement is that the user must have a GitHub account.

## Why I chose Utterances
* Less maintainance and zero cost 
* Automatic spam protection by default
* Better comments with markdown and reactions to comments
